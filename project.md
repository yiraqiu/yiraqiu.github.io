### My story

The dropdown menu project taught me to blend JavaScript's classList.toggle() with CSS transitions, creating smooth animations. Implementing backdrop-filter: blur(10px) revealed how visual hierarchy elevates user experience.

The search bar experiment demonstrated CSS's transformative power. By manipulating border-radius and pseudo-elements, I engineered a button that morphs between a circle and a barâ€”proving interfaces can convey emotion through motion.

The five star rating dynamic function was created by using HTML/CSS, featuring hover-triggered labels and animated star transitions for intuitive feedback submission. Byimproving clarity and engagement, it enhanced user interaction through smooth visual cues like color changes and tooltips.
