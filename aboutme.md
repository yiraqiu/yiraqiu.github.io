### My Storyüå± 

A former financial strategist turned code architect, I engineer solutions where quantitative rigor meets technological innovation. With a foundation in dissecting financial ecosystems at Vanguard and PwC, I now orchestrate full-stack systems, transforming spreadsheets into scalable software.

My toolkit spans Python, JavaScript, and SQL, honed through automating 20% of manual workflows and architecting data pipelines that reconcile millions of records. Beyond algorithms, I design interfaces that breathe elegance into functionality‚Äîlike search bars achieving 0.4ms render speeds and dropdown menus slashing latency by 35%.

Currently pursuing a Master‚Äôs in Computer Information Technology at UPenn, I thrive at the intersection of fintech and pure tech: translating audit-tested precision into clean code, and market analytics into intuitive dashboards. Whether debugging tax algorithms or optimizing DOM performance, I bridge the gap between boardroom logic and machine logic‚Äîone semicolon at a time.
